# MyAika User Guide

Last updated: February 21, 2026

## Purpose
This guide is a complete, tab-by-tab walkthrough of MyAika. It explains what each feature does, why you would use it, and how to use it safely and effectively. It also includes step-by-step scenarios for the trading stack.

This is an educational guide and not financial advice. Always use paper mode first and never trade money you cannot afford to lose.

## Quickstart
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `npm run dev:server`
3. Start the web UI: `npm run dev:web`
4. Open the UI: `http://localhost:3000`

If you are on iPad/Safari, microphone access requires HTTPS. Use `npm run dev:ipad` or `npm run dev:web:https`.

## Navigation Map (Top Tabs)
- `Chat`: Conversational UI, voice control, and general assistant use.
- `Recordings`: Meeting Copilot for recording, transcription, and meeting notes.
- `Tools`: MCP-lite tool browser, direct tool execution, approvals, and history.
- `Action Runner`: Headless browser automation with approval gates and artifacts.
- `Teach Mode`: Record and run reusable browser macros.
- `Fireflies`: Fireflies meeting sync, RAG Q&A, and knowledge graph.
- `Trading`: Full trading terminal with paper, backtest, options, knowledge RAG, and scenarios.
- `Safety`: Autonomy controls, approval rules, kill switch, and audit log.
- `Canvas`: Live cards that Aika updates from server events.
- `Features`: MCP discovery and Connections portal.
- `Settings`: Integrations, Skills, Trading preferences, Appearance, Voice controls, plus `Legacy` (Aika Tools workbench).
- `Debug`: System health, voice pipeline checks, and logs.
- `Guide`: This user guide in-app.

## Global Concepts
- Local-first: Most state (memory, recordings, RAG, audit logs) stays in `data/` locally.
- Safety-first: Risky actions are deny-by-default and require approvals.
- RAG: Retrieval-augmented generation is used for Fireflies and Trading knowledge.
- Approvals: High-risk actions route through approvals before execution.

## AIKA Executive Layer
AIKA adds a 38-module executive assistant system on top of the existing Aika stack. Modules are declarative (Trigger → Inputs → Actions → Outputs → Update policy) and span five levels from Clerk to God Tier advisory.

Key outcomes:
- Save time through automation and structured summaries.
- Increase decision clarity via decision briefs and risk surfacing.
- Reduce risk with confirmations and guardrails.
- Compound leverage with weekly automation upgrades.

## Command Grammar
Use the same grammar across voice, chat, and Telegram:
- `AIKA, run <ModuleName> ...`
- `AIKA, start <ModeName> ...`
- `AIKA, watch <Thing> ...`
- `AIKA, brief me on <Topic> ...`
- `AIKA, draft <Artifact> ...`
- `AIKA, summarize <Input> ...`
- `AIKA, decide between <OptionA> and <OptionB> using <criteria> ...`
- `AIKA, configure <Setting> to <Value> ...`
- `AIKA, stop watching <Thing> ...`
- `AIKA, show my modules ...`
- `AIKA, run my daily digest.`

## No-Integrations Mode
If integrations are not connected, use structured prefixes to provide inputs and receive manual checklists:
- `EMAIL:`
- `CALENDAR EXPORT:`
- `KPI SNAPSHOT:`
- `PROJECT STATUS:`
- `NOTE:`

AIKA responds with structured output, a manual execution checklist, and queues the action in the Manual Action Queue.

## Digests + Watchtower
AIKA produces three proactive updates:
- Daily Digest: top priorities, calendar prep, inbox summary, risks, leverage suggestion.
- Midday Pulse: only when notable changes are detected.
- Weekly Review: wins, misses, risks, next-week focus, automation upgrades backlog.

Watchtower supports KPI drift detection, threshold alerts, and change diffs. Each watch item stores events with severity and summary.

## Runbooks + Mission Mode
Runbooks are declarative, phased workflows (Analyze → Synthesize → Deliverables). Mission Mode runs these end-to-end with manual checklists or tool calls depending on integration availability.
